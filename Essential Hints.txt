This project is just a testing project to show you how to dockerize a project and push it to you're github repository.
Recording to that , the codes used for this project is not complete and you can develope them.In addition, the docker-compose file (with .yml suffix) is no included
in this project . If you want to use the other services of docker for example if you have a database manager app (such as sql or etc), to manage the 
containers you have to make a docker-compose file and apply it through your dockerization .
